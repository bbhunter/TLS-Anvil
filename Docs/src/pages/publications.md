### USENIX Security

We released TLS-Anvil along with our paper for USENIX Security 2022.    
[TLS-Anvil: Adapting Combinatorial Testing for TLS Libraries](/TLS-Anvil-Paper.pdf)

The paper covers the following topics:
* Introduction to Combinatorial Testing
* Challenges developing TLS-Anvil
* High level overview how TLS-Anvil executes the tests
* Methodology of developing test cases
* Results of analyzing 13 different TLS libraries with TLS-Anvil

### Master Thesis 2020

TLS-Anvil is a further development of the test suite developed as part of a [master's thesis](/TLS-Testsuite_Master_thesis.pdf) in 2020 by Philipp Nieting. At this stage the full-fledged combinatorial testing approach was not part of the project. However, the foundation of TLS-Anvil, i.e. the API to create tests with TLS-Anvil as well as the first set of tests was developed in this thesis.

The thesis was kindly supported by [TÜViT](https://tuvit.de) at [Ruhr-Universität Bochum](https://informatik.rub.de/nds/).
