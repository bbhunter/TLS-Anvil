Future extensions MUST define their interaction with 0-RTT.

Message boundaries are handled differently depending on the underlying ContentType.  Any future content types MUST specify appropriate rules.

An AEAD algorithm used in TLS 1.3 MUST NOT produce an expansion greater than 255 octets.

An AEAD algorithm where N_MAX is less than 8 bytes MUST NOT be used with TLS.

Future specifications MUST NOT define a use of exporters that permit both an empty context and no context with the same label.

TLS does not currently permit the server to send a certificate_request message in non-certificate-based handshakes (e.g., PSK).  If this restriction were to be relaxed in future, the client's signature would not cover the server's certificate directly. However, if the PSK was established through a NewSessionTicket, the client's signature would transitively cover the server's certificate through the PSK binder.  [PSK-FINISHED] describes a concrete attack on constructions that do not bind to the server's certificate (see also [Kraw16]).  It is unsafe to use certificate-based client authentication when the client might potentially share the same PSK/key-id pair with two different endpoints.  Implementations MUST NOT combine external PSKs with certificate-based authentication of either the client or the server unless negotiated by some extension.

IESG Approval is REQUIRED for a Y->N transition.
