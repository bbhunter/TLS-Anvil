Alerts MUST now be sent in many cases.

After a certificate_request, if no certificates are available, clients now MUST send an empty certificate list.

New cipher suites MUST explicitly specify a PRF and, in general, SHOULD use the TLS PRF with SHA-256 or a stronger standard hash function.

The padding length MUST be such that the total size of the GenericBlockCipher structure is a multiple of the cipher's block length.

Each AEAD cipher suite MUST specify how the nonce supplied to the AEAD operation is constructed, and what is the length of the GenericAEADCipher.nonce_explicit part.

Each AEAD cipher MUST NOT produce an expansion of greater than 1024 bytes.

New key exchange methods can be created by specifying a format for these messages and by defining the use of the messages to allow the client and server to agree upon a shared secret.  This secret MUST be quite long; currently defined key exchange methods exchange secrets that range from 46 bytes upwards.

 Other key exchange algorithms, such as those defined in [TLSECC], MUST specify whether the ServerKeyExchange message is sent or not; and if the message is sent, its contents.
 
For the PRF defined in Section 5, the Hash MUST be the Hash used as the basis for the PRF.  Any cipher suite which defines a different PRF MUST also define the Hash to use in the Finished computation.

Future cipher suites MAY specify other lengths but such length MUST be at least 12 bytes.
