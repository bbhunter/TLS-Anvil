Whenever an implementation encounters a condition which is defined as a fatal alert, it MUST send the appropriate alert prior to closing the connection.

The handshake protocol messages are presented below in the order they MUST be sent; sending handshake messages in an unexpected order results in a fatal error.

However, once the ChangeCipherSpec has been sent, the new CipherSpec MUST be used.

The server MUST send a Certificate message whenever the agreed- upon key exchange method uses certificates for authentication (this includes all key exchange methods defined in this document except DH_anon).  This message will always immediately follow the ServerHello message.

Otherwise, it MUST be the first message sent by the client after it receives the ServerHelloDone message.

Application data MUST NOT be sent prior to the completion of the first handshake (before a cipher suite other than TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL is established).

At this point, both client and server MUST send ChangeCipherSpec messages and proceed directly to Finished messages.

and (as for all other messages) it MUST check that the amount of data in the message precisely matches one of these formats; if not, then it MUST send a fatal "decode_error" alert.
